# scattering transform (ST)

The scattering transform provides a novel statistical vocabulary to characterize textures in a signal / field. It yields a compact set of coefficients, measuring the strengths of fluctuations and patterns defined by various combinations of scales. In this sense, it is similar to the power spectrum. However, it captures much more information than the power spectrum, in particular non-Gaussian textures, which are ubiquitous in astronomical/physical data.


This repository provides a compact python script to calculate the scattering coefficients of 2D fields (images).
