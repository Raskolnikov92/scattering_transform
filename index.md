## The need for better statistics
Quantifying textures and patterns in a field requires a statistical vocabulary. 
The power spectrum, although widely used for a number of good reasons, extracts only limited information from a field.
Below, I show two fields with very different textures and features but exactly the same power spectrum.
To distinguish them, one needs to go beyond power spectrum!

## The scattering transform
The scattering transform is a

## Visualisation
What does a field look like in the eye of particular summary statistics? 
This question can be addressed by conducting an image generation using those statistics.
In the figure below I show the results from power spectrum, bispectrum, and scattering coefficients.
It is thrilling to see how performs well.
